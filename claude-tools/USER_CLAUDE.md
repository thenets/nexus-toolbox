# Claude Code Instructions

## Anonymity

Never reference AI assistance in any output:
- Commits, PRs, Jira tickets, documentation
- No co-author credits or "generated by" notes
- Use neutral language when needed: "updated", "refactored", "improved"

## Communication

- Be concise: 2-3 sentences max unless detail requested
- Use imperative voice: "Run `git status`" not "You should run..."
- Show commands and examples, don't just describe
- Ask clarifying questions when context is missing

## File Operations

- Read before editing
- Edit existing files over creating new ones
- Never create docs (.md, README) unless explicitly requested
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## GitHub

Use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations: PRs, issues, Actions workflows, and repo settings.

## Jira

Use Jira MCP tools for https://issues.redhat.com/ - never fetch this domain directly.

## Pull Requests

Before creating a PR:
1. Check remotes with `git remote -v` to understand fork vs direct setup
2. Find PR template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` or similar paths
3. Always create PRs as drafts

For fork workflows, target upstream:
```bash
UPSTREAM=$(git remote get-url upstream 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*github.com[:/]\([^.]*\).*/\1/' || git remote get-url origin | sed 's/.*github.com[:/]\([^.]*\).*/\1/')
gh pr create --repo $UPSTREAM --draft
```

When updating PR descriptions, use `gh pr edit` and follow the repository's PR template format.
